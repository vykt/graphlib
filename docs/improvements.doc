Below is a list of future modifications to the code to reduce runtime complexity
or improve reliability:

1) search node type, s_node_t, should store its own index inside the search queue, 
s_queue. This would avoid having to search through all nodes of the graph for a
match.

2) Another struct should be created where a vector is used to store pointers to
search nodes, s_node_t. IDs of search nodes can be used as indexes in this vector.
This would once again remove the need to search through the graph sequentially,
reducing complexity. This vector would need to be constructed at time of search,
as modification of the graph will likely lead to invalidating some entries.
