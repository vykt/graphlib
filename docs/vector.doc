vykt's graph library - vectors
------------------------------


	vector_t:

	The vector type, creates a vector struct with members:

		char * vector 	 - Vector memory in heap.
	
		size_t data_size - Size of an individual element inside the vector.

		uint64_t length  - Number of elements currently in the vector.



To use a vector, define a vector struct using the vector_t type. Once done, the
vector needs to be initialised via the builder function. The vector must be
initialised otherwise all functions called on it will fail.

	vector_ini():

	Vector initialiser function. Takes:

		vector_t * v     - Vector to initialise.

		size_t data_size - Size of each element in the vector. Get with sizeof().
	
	Returns:

		SUCCESS  - Successful execution.
		NULL_ERR - One or more necessary arguments are NULL.



If a vector ever needs to be terminated without termination of the program, the
memory it holds in the heap should be freed using the termination function.

	vector_end():

	Vector termination function. Frees memory. Takes:

		vector_t * v - Vector to terminate.

	Returns:

		SUCCESS  - Successful execution.
		NULL_ERR - One or more necessary arguments are NULL.



Values can be added, removed and retrieved or set from the vector using the 4
operation functions.

	vector_set():

	Set an existing entry in the vector to a new value. Takes:

		vector_t * v - Vector to operate on.

		uint64_t pos - Index position to set value of.

		char * data  - New value of entry.

	Returns:

		SUCCESS           - Successful execution.
		NULL_ERR          - One or more necessary arguments are NULL.
		OUT_OF_BOUNDS_ERR - Attemting to remove index out of range.

	--- --- ---

	vector_add():

	Add item to a vector. Takes:

		vector_t * v   - Vector to add to.

		uint64_t pos   - Position to add to.

		char * data    - Data to add to the vector.

		uint8_t append - Whether to append to the end of the vector. If set to
		                 true, value of pos is ignored.
		                   VECTOR_APPEND_TRUE
						   VECTOR_APPEND_FALSE

	Returns:

		SUCCESS           - Successful execution.
		NULL_ERR          - One or more necessary arguments are NULL.
		FULL_ERR          - Vector is full.
		OUT_OF_BOUNDS_ERR - Attemting to remove index out of range.
		MEM_ERR           - Unable to reallocate vector heap memory.

	--- --- ---

	vector_rmv():

	Remove item from a vector. Takes:

		vector_t * v - Vector to remove from.
		uint64_t pos - Position to remove.

	Returns:

		SUCCESS           - Successful Execution.
		NULL_ERR          - One or more necessary arguments are NULL.
		EMPTY_ERR         - Vector is empty, unable to remove.
		OUT_OF_BOUNDS_ERR - Attemting to remove index out of range.
		MEM_ERR           - Unable to reallocate vector heap memory.

	--- --- ---

	vector_get():

	Remove item from a vector. Note that data has to be a pointer to malloc'ed
	memory. Takes:

		vector_t * v - Vector to get from.
		uint64_t pos - Position to get.
		char * data  - Buffer to write data to.

	Returns:

		SUCCESS           - Successful Execution.
		NULL_ERR          - One or more necessary arguments are NULL.
		EMPTY_ERR         - Vector is empty, unable to remove.
		OUT_OF_BOUNDS_ERR - Attemting to remove index out of range.



Notes:

Notice that the pointer to the data stored by the vector is a character pointer.
This is done to allow for byte by byte pointer arithmetic. Values can be stored
and retrieved without casting, although casting would resolve warnings.
