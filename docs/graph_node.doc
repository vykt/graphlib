vykt's graph library - graph nodes
----------------------------------

	graph_node_t:

	The graph node type, creates a graph_node struct with members:

		char * data           - Pointer to data held by node, in heap. Any data type.

		size_t data_size      - Size of data held by node.

		vector_t neighbours   - Vector of pointers to neighbouring nodes.

		vector_t edge_weights - Vector of weights of each edge to neighbouring nodes.



To create a graph node, define a graph_node struct using graph_node_t type. Once done,
the graph node needs to be initialised via te builder function. The graph node must
be initialised, otherwise all other functions will fail.

	graph_node_ini():

	Graph node initialiser function. Takes:

		graph_node_t * n - Graph node to initialise.

		char * data      - Data to place in node.

		size_t data_size - Size of data in node.

		uint64_t id      - ID of node.

	Returns:

		SUCCESS  - Successful execution.
		NULL_ERR - One or more necessary arguments are NULL.
		MEM_ERR  - Unable to allocate/reallocate memory.


If a vector ever needs to be terminated, the graph_node_end() function should be used
to free any allocated memory and remove the node from neighbour listings of
neighbouring nodes.

	graph_node_end():

	Graph node terminator function. Takes:

		graph_node_t * n - Graph node to terminate.

	Returns:

		SUCCESS  - Successful execution.
		NULL_ERR - One or more necessary arguments are NULL.


Upon creation of a node, neighbours can be added or removed to/from it. Its data value
can also be changed.

	graph_node_set_dat():

	Set the data value of a node. Takes:

		graph_node_t * n - Subject graph node.

		char * data      - Data to set.

	Returns:

		Nothing.

	graph_node_add_nbr():

	Add neighbour to a node. Takes:

		graph_node_t * n         - Subject graph node.

		graph_node_t * neighbour - Pointer to neighbour node.

		int64_t weight           - Weight of edge to neighbour.

	Returns:

		SUCCESS           - Successful execution.
		NULL_ERR          - One or more necessary arguments are NULL.
		FULL_ERR          - Vector is full.
		OUT_OF_BOUNDS_ERR - Attemting to remove index out of range.
		MEM_ERR           - Unable to allocate/reallocate heap memory.

	--- --- ---

	graph_node_rmv_nbr():

	Remove neighour from a node. Takes:

		graph_node_t * n - Subject graph node.
		uint64_t id      - ID of neighbour node to remove.

	Returns:

		SUCCESS           - Successful execution.
		FAIL              - Unable to remove neighbour, no ID match.
		NULL_ERR          - One or more necessary arguments are NULL.
		FULL_ERR          - Vector is full.
		OUT_OF_BOUNDS_ERR - Attemting to remove index out of range.
		MEM_ERR           - Unable to allocate/reallocate heap memory.
